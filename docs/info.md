## How it works

The project works by turning the first 4 lights in a number display

## How to test

Turn switches 1-8 to see which lights in the number display turn on or off

Ex:If switches 1,and 2 are turned off, but switches 3,4,5,6,7,8 are turned on then the 1st light in the number display is turned off and the 2nd,3rd,and 4th are turned on

Therefore 2 switches connected to the same nand logic gate can turn the lights in the number display on or off depending on the inputs

## External hardware

None.
